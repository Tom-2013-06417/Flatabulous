This is a [fork](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous) of the original Flatabulous
theme by anmoljagetia, customized to suit my preferences.

# Flatabulous

This is a Flat theme for Ubuntu and other debian based Linux Systems.  This is based on the Ultra-Flat theme. Special thanks to @steftrikia and Satyajit Sahoo for the original work.

# Installation

## Update

Install it manually, if you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher. If you prefer the `.deb` installers, please download the correct one, based on the version from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases).


This theme was designed *specially* for the Unity environment on Ubuntu as I have only tested it on Ubuntu. It might not work properly for the other versions.

*The terminal*


To install the theme, you must first install the [**Unity Tweak Tool**](https://launchpad.net/unity-tweak-tool). It can be installed by simply running the command:

```
sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool
```

## Update

If you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher, run the commands below to install Ubuntu Tweak:

```
wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu xenial-getdeb apps" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak
```

or head over to their website, downloading the .deb file (recommended).

## 1. Using the .deb file for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives (Recommended)

Download the .deb file from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases/latest), double click to open with Ubuntu Software Center and click on install. Then, install the theme using ubuntu-tweak.

## 2. Using the noobslab PPA

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flatabulous-theme
```

## 3. Manually

Download the source to the theme [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.zip). If a problem occurs with your installation, kindly download the correct version based on your version of Ubuntu from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases). If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running

```
mkdir .themes
```

Now this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + H`. Alternatively, you can also place the extracted files in your `/usr/share/themes/` folder.

# Flat Icons

*Dashboard*

For icons, I use the ultra-flat-icons theme. It is available in blue (recommended), orange and mint green colors. To install this, you can run the following commands

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons
```

Alternatively, you could also run `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-orange` OR `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-green`.

based on you color preference. I recommend these flat icons, but you can also look at **Numix** and **Flattr**.

Now press your super key, search for **Ubuntu Tweak** and fire it. Under the tweaks tab, there is an option for theme. Under that select the **Flatabulous** theme. Under the icon settings, select **ultra-flat-icons**. Restart your computer, and you should be good to go! You computer will look something like this after you *restart*.
